### ABSTRACT
When estimating the average treatment effect for a binary outcome, methods that incorporate propensity scores, the G-formula, or Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) are preferred over na√Øve regression approaches which often lead misspecified models. Some methods require correct specification of the outcome model, whereas other methods require correct specification of the exposure model. Doubly-robust methods only require correct specification of one of these models. TMLE is a semiparametric doubly-robust method that enhances correct model specification by allowing flexible estimation using non-parametric machine-learning methods and requires weaker assumptions than its competitors. We provide a step-by-step guided implementation of TMLE and illustrate it in a realistic scenario based on cancer epidemiology where assumptions about correct model specification and positivity (i.e., when a study participant had zero probability of receiving the treatment) are nearly violated. This article provides a concise and reproducible educational introduction to TMLE for a binary outcome and exposure. The reader should gain sufficient understanding of TMLE from this introductory tutorial to be able to apply the method in practice. Extensive R-code is provided in easy-to-read boxes throughout the article for replicability. Stata users will find a testing implementation of TMLE and additional material in the appendix and at the following GitHub repository:
